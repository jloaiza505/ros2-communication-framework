# ros2-communication-framework
Minimal multi-node ROS2 system demonstrating publisher/subscriber communication, service coordination, parameter handling, and launch orchestration in a modular architecture.

Problem Statement

Modern robotic systems depend on reliable inter-node communication, but early-stage engineers often treat ROS2 as a scripting layer rather than a distributed system. This project addresses the need to understand deterministic message passing, service coordination, and launch orchestration in a modular ROS2 architecture. The goal is to design a minimal yet extensible multi-node system demonstrating topic publishing, service control, parameter handling, and structured launch configuration to establish a correct foundation for scalable robotic software.
